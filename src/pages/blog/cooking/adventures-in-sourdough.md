# Adventures in Sourdough


## 5 Mar 2020 - The Birth of Walter II and Scientific Thought
It occured to me that I should start taking measurements so that I can repeat this process if it turns out well.

I killed the Old Walter so that the new Walter could be born.
Put part of Old Walter into Walter II.

|Levain Weight|Flour          |Water   |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
|100g         |75g Whole Wheat|75g warm|

Split into two children:
- W2 sub 0 -> small glass jar
- W2 sub 1 -> big glass pyrex

Will differing sizes of container affect ferm rate? O2 concentration? Too much in small jar?

## Attempt 1
400g King Arthur Bread Flour
100g King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour
333ml water
125g starter
9g salt

Turned out the best so far

## Attempt 2
450g bread
100g ww
385ml water
125g starter
9g salt

overnight prove in fridge

Large pockets, flavor was lacking

## Attempt 3
### So begins self-isolation

400g bread
100g ww
365ml water
10g salt
125 starter

didn't rise a lot, froze for future use

## Attempt 4
400g bread
100g ww
350ml water
9g salt

still too wet, not enough rise

400/100 bread/ww is a good ratio

will reduce to 66% hydration for next attempt

quarentine is leading to much baking and rejoicing

## Attempt 5

Try no-knead?? Could be promising [Linkypoo](https://breadtopia.com/sourdough-technique-experiment-no-knead-vs-the-works/)

Trying no-knead, with some modifications
400g b -> 80%
100g ww -> 20%
125g starter -> 25%
333ml water -> 66%
5g salt -> 0.1%

1 hr autolyse
Add starter and salt
let rise in greased bowl for 8ish hours, or until doubled in size
shape and place in floured baneton
let rise in fridge for 10 hours
bake covered at 500 for 25, uncovered at 450 for 15.

Worked very well, accidentally left oven at 500 while uncovered, slight scorching bu otherwise crumb and bake was great. Frozen for next week.
