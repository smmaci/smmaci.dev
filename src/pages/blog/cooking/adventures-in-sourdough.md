# Adventures in Sourdough


## 5 Mar 2020 - The Birth of Walter II and Scientific Thought
It occured to me that I should start taking measurements so that I can repeat this process if it turns out well.

I killed the Old Walter so that the new Walter could be born.
Put part of Old Walter into Walter II.

|Levain Weight|Flour          |Water   |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
|100g         |75g Whole Wheat|75g warm|

Split into two children:
- W2 sub 0 -> small glass jar
- W2 sub 1 -> big glass pyrex

Will differing sizes of container affect ferm rate? O2 concentration? Too much in small jar?
