# Side Projects

## Charades

In college, my friends and I used to play charades quite a bit. We had a bucket in our living room that anyone could drop a charades prompt into. In light of the Covid-19 crisis, we have all been reconnecting over video chats, and wished that we had a way to replicate the charades games we used to play. This is my attempt at re-creating our communal charades bucket. It's a pretty simple project, but it was nice to create something that my friends and I have been able to enjoy!

You can [view this project on Github](https://github.com/smmaci/charades)

For this project, I used NextJS combined with Tailwind CSS for the frontend and the API, and Redis to store data.
