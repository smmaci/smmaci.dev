## Charades

I played a lot of charades with my friends and roommates in college. We had a bucket in our living room that anyone could drop a charades prompt into. During the Covid pandemic, we've' been keeping up over video calls, and wished that we had a way to replicate that. This is my attempt at re-creating our communal charades bucket. It's a pretty simple project, but it was nice to create something tangible for my friends.

You can [view this project on Github](https://github.com/smmaci/charades)

For this project, I used NextJS for the frontend and the API, and Redis to store data.
